Gaussian Process Regression Approximations tests.

The file RUN_EXPERIMENTS.m is the place to start.
All the scripts in this directory should be easy to modify.
Add your own datasets/approximations as described in 
RUN_EXPERIMENTS.m and loadData.m

ANALYZE_DATA produces plots of standardized mean squared error (SMSE)
and mean standardized log loss (MSLL) as a function of time for all
given datasets/method using our results stored in the
Chalupka_Williams_Murray_Results directory.
