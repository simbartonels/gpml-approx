Synthetic datasets from Carl Rasmussen

T08.mat, T04.mat and T02.mat (8, 4 and 2 dimensional Gaussian input density)
each containing 2^16 cases. T08 is noise-free whereas T04 and T02 have a noise
variance of 10^-6 (ie a noise standard deviation of 10^-3). The variables are
called x and y.

There is also a noise file (independent, unit variance Gaussian noise) T00.mat
